# README #

This is a Georgia Tech internal gem5 repository used by Tushar Krishna (tushar@ece.gatech.edu) for his Interconnection Networks course.
This is an old version of the repo (from Jan 2018) and is primarily used to build Garnet2.0 in a standalone manner.

More details: http://tusharkrishna.ece.gatech.edu/teaching/garnet_gt/

Ignore the my_scripts/build_Garnet_standlone.sh command as that is specific to the RHEL setup at the GT ECE servers.

Instead, to build the protocol just type:
 scons build/Garnet_standalone/gem5.debug
